                <p>Celaena Sardothien, the most feared assassin in the land of Erilea, has spent the last year enduring hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier. At only eighteen, she is notorious for her skills and crimes, but her capture left her broken and enslaved—until an unexpected offer changes her fate.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Prince Dorian Havilliard of Adarlan offers Celaena a deal: her freedom in exchange for serving as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin. If she can defeat twenty-three deadly opponents—thieves, warriors, and killers—she will serve the king for four years and then be granted her freedom.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Celaena travels to the glass castle in Rifthold, where she begins her training under the watchful eye of Captain Chaol Westfall, the stern and loyal head of the royal guard. As the competition unfolds, contestants begin turning up dead in gruesome ways. Celaena must uncover who—or what—is killing them before she becomes the next victim.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At the same time, she discovers ancient secrets hidden within the castle, guided by the ghost of Queen Elena and a set of strange Wyrdmarks. Her journey forces her to face dark magic, court politics, and her own complicated past.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Amidst this, Celaena develops complex bonds with both Dorian and Chaol, but refuses to let them distract her from her goal: survival and freedom.</p>
